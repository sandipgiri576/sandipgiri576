Welcome to my GitHub! I am a passionate researcher delving into the world of chemical compound space exploration, molecular design, and virtual screening. My journey revolves around blending quantum mechanics (QM), machine learning (ML), and automation to accelerate scientific discovery.

## 🔬 What I Do

- **Customize Interatomic ML Potentials:** Developing machine learning models tailored for atomic interactions.
- **Automation:** Building workflows to streamline molecular design and virtual screening.
- **Database & Web Apps:** Creating platforms for SMILES-to-property predictions and inverse molecular design.
- **Quantum Chemistry Integration:** Merging QM calculations with ML for deeper insights.

## 💡 Favorite Project
